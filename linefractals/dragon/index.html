                <p>
                    A dragon curve is any member of a family of self-similar fractal curves, which can be approximated
                    by recursive methods such as Lindenmayer systems. The dragon curve is probably most commonly thought
                    of as the shape that is generated from repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half, although there
                    are other curves that are called dragon curves that are generated differently.
