                Have a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Wikipedia</a>. Extract below.

                The Koch snowflake (also known as the Koch curve, Koch star, or Koch island) is a fractal curve
                and one of the earliest fractals to have been described. It is based on the Koch curve, which appeared
                in a 1904 paper titled "On a Continuous Curve Without Tangents, Constructible from Elementary
                Geometry" by the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch.

                The Koch snowflake can be built up iteratively, in a sequence of stages. The first stage is an
                equilateral triangle, and each successive stage is formed by adding outward bends to each side of the
                previous stage, making smaller equilateral triangles. The areas enclosed by the successive stages in the
                construction of the snowflake converge to

                times the area of the original triangle, while the perimeters of the successive stages increase without
                bound. Consequently, the snowflake encloses a finite area, but has an infinite perimeter.

                The Koch snowflake has been constructed as an example of a continuous curve where drawing a tangent line
                to any point is impossible. Unlike the earlier Weierstrass function where the proof was purely
                analytical, the Koch snowflake was created to be possible to geometrically represent at the time, so
                that this property could also be seen through "naive intuition".

                Changing the number of iterations will kick-off an timed animation showing you all the steps. So
                please be patient until the animation is finished before changing the number again.
