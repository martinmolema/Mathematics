# MartinÂ´s Math Problem Page
Let's be honest: no normal person really loves maths. However, when becoming a Software Engineer in the
nineties I was forced to learn a lot of Math. This even made me loose interest in the subject so I switched
from the University to a University of Applied Sciences (HBO in Dutch). 

However, now and then I see things 'out there' that I find fascinating that have their basis in Mathematics.
In this repository I will add projects that I have created.

There are currently two projects:
1. Mandelbrot fractal
2. Rotating balls
3. Burning ship fractal
4. Lightswitch problem
5. Chaos game (Sierpinski)

You can see the working code here: [http://wiskunde.molema.org](http://wiskunde.molema.org) and play with it
yourself.
