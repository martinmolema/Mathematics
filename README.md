# Martin's Math Problem Page
Let's be honest: no normal person really loves maths. However, when becoming a Software Engineer in the
nineties I was forced to learn a lot of Math. This even made me loose interest in the subject so I switched
from the University to a University of Applied Sciences (HBO in Dutch). 

However, now and then I see things 'out there' that I find fascinating that have their basis in Mathematics.
In this repository I will add projects that I have created.

The following projects are available:
1. Mandelbrot fractal
2. Rotating balls
3. Burning ship fractal
4. Lightswitch problem
5. Chaos game (Sierpinski)
6. Knight's Tour Chess problem
7. Theorode's Spiral of integer square roots
8. Archimedean Spiral using polar coordinates
9. Fibonacci squares
10. Line fractals
  * Canopy fractal
  * Dragon curve
  * Gosper curve
  * Snowflake
  * Barnsley fern
  * Peano curve
  * Fibonacci spiral
  * Fibonacci snowflake 

You can see the working code here: [http://math.molema.org](http://wiskunde.molema.org) and play with it
yourself.
