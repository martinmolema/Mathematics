                In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two
                preceding ones. Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly
                denoted
                <math>
                    <msub>
                        <mi>F</mi>
                        <mi>n</mi>
                    </msub>
                </math>
                . The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1
                and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1, the sequence begins

                0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....

                The Fibonacci numbers were first described in Indian mathematics as early as 200 BC in work by Pingala
                on enumerating possible patterns of Sanskrit poetry formed from syllables of two lengths.They
                are named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, also known as Fibonacci, who introduced the
                sequence to Western European mathematics in his 1202 book Liber Abaci.
