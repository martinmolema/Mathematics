            The Archimedean spiral (also known as the arithmetic spiral) is a spiral named after the 3rd-century BC
            Greek mathematician Archimedes. It is the locus corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving
            away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line that rotates with constant angular velocity.
            Equivalently, in polar coordinates (r, θ) it can be described by the equation<br>
            <math>
                <mi>r</mi>
                <mo>=</mo>
                <mi>b</mi>
                <mo>⋅</mo>
                <mi>θ</mi>
            </math>
            <br>
            with real number <math><mi>b</mi></math>. Changing the parameter b controls the distance between loops.

            From the above equation, it can thus be stated: position of particle from point of start is proportional to
            angle θ as time elapses.

            Archimedes described such a spiral in his book On Spirals. Conon of Samos was a friend of his and Pappus
            states that this spiral was discovered by Conon.
