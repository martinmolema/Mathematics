        Let's be honest: no normal person really loves maths. However, when becoming a Software Engineer in the
        nineties I was forced to learn a lot of Math. This even made me loose interest in the subject so I switched
        from the University to a University of Applied Sciences (HBO in Dutch).
        </p>
        <p>
        However, now and then I see things 'out there' that I find fascinating that have their basis in Mathematics.
        In this repository I will add projects that I have created.
        </p>
        <p>I get some inspiration from the great guys at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/numberphile" target="_blank">Numberphile!</a>.
            The way they explain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snHKEpCv0Hk" target="_blank">geometry</a>
            and how the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFftmWSzgmk" target="_blank">Mandelbrot Fractal</a>
            works inspired me to create a few projects
            that are accessible through the web.
        </p>
        <p>There are currently four projects:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mandelbrot ship fractal</li>
            <li>Burning ship fractal</li>
            <li>Rotating balls</li>
        </ol>
        <P><a href="circles">Here</a> you can find my different versions of rotating circles.</P>
        <P><a href="mandelbrot">Here</a> you can find my different versions of the Mandelbrot fractal.</P>
        <P><a href="burningship/v01">Here</a> you can find my different versions of the burningship fractal.</P>
        <P><a href="lightswitchproblem">Here</a> you can find my visualisation of the Lightswitch problem.</P>
