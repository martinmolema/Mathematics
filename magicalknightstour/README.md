# Knights Tour problem

See [Numberphile's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RytNZ2btZxE) video and
the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight's_tour). Extract below.

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly
once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the
board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed (or re-entrant); otherwise, it is open.

The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Creating a program to find a knight's
tour is a common problem given to computer science students. Variations of the knight's tour problem involve
chessboards of different sizes than the usual 8 Ã— 8, as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards.

Here you will find a Javascript file you can run to find all the solutions to
this problem for 8x8 squares. As far as I can determine there are 172227. These you can find in the file "
8x8-0,0.solutions.json" on the GitHub Page.

Although there are no magical solutions in the 8x8 squares board, there is also a Python script that uses a JSON-file (
like 8x8-0,0.solutions.json) to find magical squares.

Please be patient so the script will find the first few iterations.
